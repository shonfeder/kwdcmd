#+TITLE: KwdCmd: Keywords to Write Command Lines

Partial porcelain around Cmdliner. Cmdliner is a powerful library
for composable command lines interfaces, but it's a bit low level, and I always
have to look up the documentation.

This thin wrapper library is just an executable cookbook for common usage
patterns of Cmdliner.

This library is in very early stages, and is growing as the need for patterns
arises.
